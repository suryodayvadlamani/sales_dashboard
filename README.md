# Why Apex charts

We have many chart libraries for Javascript and few are customised specific to react needs. Among those i have choosen Apex charts for below Reasons:

1. Apex charts provide 100+ ready to-use samples
2. It helps in building interactive data visualizations.
3. It provides features like zoom in, zoom out and slice default.
4. When dev time is less and need a rich interface with full of features APex is the best choice

# mocking api

I have used a json sample data base and i have used axios mock adapter to mock the request as network request and fetch data

# Api calls

I chose axios as the library to make any api calls as it has lot of inbuilt features, for example intercepting api calls, adding cookies or custom headers e.t.c

# State management
I chose Tanstack Query as compartively it is a best library which uses a actual reactive of managing state. It uses observable concept. there are many benifits in using this for example; To fetch data and validate or make any call we have to write a repetitive code in react but it will handle this by default by giving dependecy array as query key
